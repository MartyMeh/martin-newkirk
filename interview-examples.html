                        <div class="star-content">Faced critical business constraints: high theft risk (up to 5% of fleet stolen per quarter), owner growth barriers limiting trip growth, and installation friction preventing scale. The existing "Instant Key" model required full device installation on every car, with keys stored in lockboxes on vehicles - creating both security risks and operational bottlenecks.</div>

                        <div class="star-content">Proposed and championed the lightest-touch approach: Key Swap required manual key exchanges (more friction per trip) but eliminated installation requirements and theft risk, dramatically reducing signup friction. Strategic hypothesis: get many more owners on platform quickly, then convert high-performing ones to Instant Key while moving poor performers off. Complete overhaul of onboarding flow, admin site, and booking flow - essentially building a new product into existing system. Coordinated between Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams. Eliminated manual sales and onboarding processes (owners self-onboarded), shifted installation team to sending kits, conducted thorough testing. Tracked owner signup rates, car utilization rates, owner ratings, and customer service call volumes. Faced challenges: initial low utilization and owner earnings led to disillusionment, increased customer service calls. Implemented solutions: monitored and removed poor-performing owners, encouraged lockboxes to reduce friction, developed and rolled out self-installation kits.</div>

                        <div class="star-content">Despite initial disruption, Key Swap became essential to company growth. By Uber's acquisition, reached 10,000 cars with 60% on Key Swap. Product was instrumental in demonstrating growth trajectory and scale that attracted acquisition interest - without it, company likely wouldn't have reached numbers needed to be attractive acquisition target.</div>

                        <div class="star-content">Proposed prioritizing SEO work because: (a) SEO requires time to compound and grow, so starting earlier maximized long-term value, and (b) strategically, it was better to expand the top of the funnel first - getting more users into the system - before optimizing conversion rates. We ultimately delivered both projects, but the strategic sequencing decision ensured we maximized impact given resource constraints.</div>
