# Personal Statement - Ofgem Product Manager Application

## Experience of working in an Agile development environment, and knowledge of software development life cycles

Throughout my career, I have worked extensively in Agile environments, delivering products across complete software development life cycles. At Car Next Door (acquired by Uber in 2022), I served as Product Manager and later Strategy & Operations Lead, where I worked directly with engineering and design teams using Agile methodologies to deliver features for Australia's leading peer-to-peer carsharing platform. I participated in sprint planning, backlog refinement, and retrospectives, ensuring our development cycles remained focused on delivering user value whilst maintaining technical quality.

As founder of Photonik, a professional solar design software platform, I have managed the complete product life cycle for over 10 years—from initial concept and development through to ongoing maintenance and feature enhancement. The platform now serves over 2,000 installers across more than 100 countries, requiring continuous iteration based on user feedback, regulatory changes, and evolving industry standards. I work closely with our development team to prioritise features, manage technical debt, and ensure releases are thoroughly tested before deployment. This long-term stewardship has given me deep understanding of how products evolve through their life cycles, from rapid growth phases requiring quick iteration to mature phases requiring stability and careful change management.

## Drive decisions based on data and insight models by defining and monitoring KPIs for performance, reliability and user satisfaction

Data-driven decision-making has been fundamental to my approach throughout my career. At Car Next Door, I established product analytics frameworks to track key metrics across the customer journey—from acquisition and activation through to retention and revenue. I used tools including Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and internal dashboards to monitor conversion rates, user engagement patterns, and operational efficiency. This data informed our product roadmap priorities, helping us identify high-impact opportunities such as optimising our onboarding flow.

For Photonik, I developed and monitor a comprehensive suite of KPIs covering product performance, user satisfaction, and business outcomes. I track metrics including daily active users, feature adoption rates, design completion times, error rates, and customer support ticket volumes. By analysing usage patterns and user behaviour data, I can identify pain points, prioritise improvements, and validate whether new features deliver the intended value.

I also established feedback loops combining quantitative metrics with qualitative insights from user interviews, support tickets, and industry forums. This holistic approach ensures decisions are grounded in real user needs whilst being validated by measurable outcomes.

## Proven organisation and prioritisation skills, with the ability to manage stakeholders with conflicting needs

Managing competing stakeholder priorities has been central to my role throughout my career. At Car Next Door, I worked at the intersection of multiple stakeholder groups—car owners wanting to maximise earnings, borrowers seeking convenient and affordable access, operations teams managing risk and compliance, and executives focused on growth and profitability. Each group had legitimate but sometimes conflicting needs, and my role was to balance these whilst keeping the product roadmap focused on delivering sustainable value.

I developed frameworks for prioritising work based on impact, effort, strategic alignment, and stakeholder urgency. I facilitated regular stakeholder meetings to gather input, communicate trade-offs, and build shared understanding of why certain decisions were made. During the transition from Car Next Door to Uber Carshare, I led cross-functional planning cycles and OKR processes that kept multiple teams aligned during a period of significant organisational change. This required exceptional organisational skills, clear communication, and the ability to make difficult prioritisation decisions when resources were constrained.

As a founder managing multiple products alongside my product leadership roles, I have refined my ability to juggle competing priorities, manage my time effectively, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks. I use project management tools including Asana and Notion to track commitments, maintain detailed roadmaps, and ensure stakeholders have visibility into progress. I am comfortable saying no when necessary, whilst explaining the rationale and offering alternative solutions or timelines.

My experience in the clean energy sector—an industry heavily influenced by government policy, regulatory requirements, and rapidly evolving technology—has prepared me well for managing stakeholders with diverse and sometimes conflicting needs. I understand how to balance regulatory compliance with user experience, short-term operational needs with long-term strategic goals, and innovation with stability.

## Experience in planning, executing and managing User Acceptance Testing activities

Throughout my product management career, I have led UAT activities as a critical component of our quality assurance process. At Car Next Door, I designed UAT plans for major feature releases, coordinating testing activities across internal teams and external users. I created comprehensive test scenarios covering functional requirements, edge cases, and user workflows, ensuring features worked as intended before release. I maintained detailed testing documentation, tracked defects, managed the bug triage process, and made go/no-go decisions based on testing outcomes.

For Photonik, I established structured UAT processes for significant releases, particularly those affecting core functionality like solar design calculations, regulatory compliance features, or integrations with third-party systems. I recruit representative users from our customer base to participate in beta testing programmes, provide them with clear testing instructions and scenarios, gather their feedback systematically, and work with our development team to address issues before full release. I understand the importance of balancing thoroughness with speed, ensuring we test rigorously without creating unnecessary delays.

I have also managed the coordination of testing activities across different stakeholder groups, including technical teams validating system performance, business users confirming functionality meets requirements, and end users ensuring the solution works in real-world scenarios. I facilitate UAT kick-off meetings, provide regular status updates, and ensure all parties understand their responsibilities and timelines.

## Formal Agile or Product Manager qualifications, or Product Manager experience

Whilst I do not hold formal Agile or Product Manager certifications, I bring over 10 years of hands-on product management experience across multiple organisations and products. I have worked in Agile environments throughout my career, applying Scrum and Kanban methodologies to deliver products effectively. My practical experience spans the full spectrum of product management responsibilities—from strategic vision and roadmap development through to hands-on execution, stakeholder management, and performance measurement.

My experience is particularly relevant to Ofgem's context given my deep domain knowledge in the energy sector. I have spent my entire career in clean energy and sustainable transport, giving me strong understanding of renewable energy systems, energy efficiency programmes, regulatory frameworks, and the complexities of government support schemes. This sector knowledge, combined with my product management expertise, positions me to quickly understand Ofgem's products and contribute meaningfully from day one.

I am committed to continuous professional development and would welcome the opportunity to pursue formal Agile or Product Manager certifications as part of my role at Ofgem. My track record demonstrates that I can deliver results, lead cross-functional teams, and drive product success in complex, regulated environments.

## Conclusion

I am excited by the opportunity to bring my product management expertise and clean energy sector knowledge to Ofgem's Digital Delivery Hub. The chance to contribute to products that support the UK's transition to Net Zero whilst protecting energy consumers aligns perfectly with my professional experience and personal values. I am confident that my skills in Agile product delivery, data-driven decision-making, stakeholder management, and UAT leadership will enable me to make immediate impact whilst continuing to grow and develop in this important role.
