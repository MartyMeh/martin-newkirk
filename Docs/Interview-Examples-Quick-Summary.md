**Maps to:** Agile Development, Delivering at Pace, Making Effective Decisions (technical/strategic)


### 2. UAT & Quality Assurance Process (Photonik & CND) ⭐
**Quick Summary:** Established and led user acceptance testing practices across both organizations:

**Photonik:** Recruit and coordinate 3-4 installers across different countries (AU, ZA, US) to test features on staging environment pre-release. Particularly rigorous for regulatory compliance features - implement step-by-step verification of government scheme calculations (STCs) against regulator requirements, with automated tests and detailed logging. Built in-app bug reporting system, daily analytics monitoring, and structured error tracking.

**Car Next Door:** Introduced STAFF user group for early production access and beta testing before wider release. Extended to select heavy users as beta community. Coordinated operations team testing of relevant workflows. Engaged Head of Legal to review compliance features pre-deployment. Implemented prioritized bug tracking system (P0-P3) with clear escalation protocols - P0 bugs meant all-hands response before any other work proceeded.

**Maps to:** UAT Planning and Management, Regulatory Compliance Testing, Stakeholder Management, Quality Assurance, Risk Management

**Why this is strong:** Demonstrates appropriate UAT for agile environments - phased rollouts, beta testing, compliance verification, and post-release monitoring rather than heavy waterfall processes.

## Uber Carshare - Policy, Safety & Risk programs lead (2024) 

### 3. Vehicle Safety Policy Framework Overhaul (2024) ⭐
**Quick Summary:** As Policy, Safety & Risk Programs Lead, identified that vehicle safety policies had evolved piecemeal over time, creating inconsistencies and gaps. Deactivation frameworks weren't consistently applied, and we lacked a unified safety dashboard to monitor fleet-wide safety performance. In a peer-to-peer carsharing environment, safety is paramount - inconsistency creates both user risk and regulatory exposure, particularly critical given Uber's very high safety standards (their #1 value after learning hard lessons in early years).

Led comprehensive overhaul of the entire vehicle safety policy framework to ensure consistency, improve monitoring, and enhance proactive safety risk management. Conducted thorough review of existing safety policies to identify gaps and inconsistencies. Designed new deactivation frameworks with clear criteria and escalation pathways. Implemented safety dashboard providing real-time visibility into fleet safety metrics, enabling proactive identification of issues before they became critical. Coordinated review and resolution processes for critical safety issues across the fleet. Developed training and communication materials for operations teams to ensure consistent application. Established regular review cadence to ensure policies remained current and responsive to emerging risks.

Results: Created consistent, defensible safety policy framework aligned with Uber's standards. Safety dashboard enabled proactive issue identification and faster response times to safety concerns through clearer processes. Reduced regulatory risk through better documentation and consistency. Built foundation for safer fleet and better user protection.

**Relevance to Ofgem:** This experience in managing safety and compliance frameworks in a regulated environment directly prepares me for Ofgem's context, where products must meet statutory obligations and protect vulnerable consumers. The safety dashboard approach mirrors the KPI monitoring that would be essential for scheme administration products.

## Car Next Door / Uber Carshare - Senior Associate, Strategy & Operations (2022 - 2024)

### 4. AFCA Complaints Compliance System (2023) ⭐
**Quick Summary:** Led urgent compliance project to meet Australia's financial regulator (AFCA - Australian Financial Complaints Authority) requirements. Company was deemed to offer a financial product (insurance when borrowers rented cars) and was non-compliant. Under heightened Uber brand scrutiny, built comprehensive complaints system including: policy framework, functionality for customers to complain at every transaction point, recording systems, escalation pathways up to the ombudsman, analytics dashboards, and frontline training. Race against time with competing resource constraints (frontline capacity, development resources needed for growth initiatives). Essential compliance work requiring speed AND quality.

**Maps to:** Making Effective Decisions, Delivering at Pace, Stakeholder Management (conflicting needs), Regulatory Compliance, Data-driven KPIs, Changing and Improving

**Why this is powerful for Ofgem:** Direct experience being regulated, understanding ombudsman escalation processes, building systems to meet regulator requirements while managing competing business priorities

## Car Next Door - Product Manager (2018 - 2021)

### 7. Agile & OKR Implementation (2018 onwards) ⭐
**Quick Summary:** As Car Next Door's first Product Manager, established agile development processes and OKR framework from scratch. Conducted extensive research including: consulting with experienced internal developers, reading multiple books on Scrum and agile practices, and most valuably - finding and meeting with experts at leading tech companies (Tech Lead at Atlassian, Product Manager at Google). Had multiple in-depth discussions to understand how successful organizations implement agile and OKRs. Synthesized learnings and worked with leadership team and broader organization to design and implement tailored processes. Continued to lead and evolve OKR process company-wide through 2022+, including executive approval cycles, strategy setting, quarterly planning, and retrospectives.

**Maps to:** Changing and Improving, Agile Development, Making Effective Decisions, Communicating and Influencing, Stakeholder Management

**Why this is powerful:** Shows ability to establish processes from scratch through research, learning from best practices, and adapting to organizational context. Demonstrates initiative in seeking out experts and translating external knowledge to internal implementation.


### 8. Key Swap Product Launch - New Carshare Onboarding Model (2020 - 2021) ⭐
**Quick Summary:** Led development of an entirely new carshare product offering ("Key Swap") to address critical business constraints: high theft risk (up to 5% of fleet stolen per quarter), owner growth barriers limiting trip growth, and installation friction preventing scale. The existing "Instant Key" model required full device installation on every car, with keys stored in lockboxes on vehicles - creating both security risks and operational bottlenecks.

Proposed and championed the lightest-touch approach: Key Swap required manual key exchanges between owners and borrowers (more friction per trip) but eliminated installation requirements and theft risk, dramatically reducing signup friction. Strategic hypothesis: get many more owners on the platform quickly, then convert high-performing ones to Instant Key while moving poor performers off. This was a massive undertaking - complete overhaul of onboarding flow, admin site, and booking flow, essentially building a new product into the existing system. As the company's first Product Manager, this was my first major feature leadership, representing a steep learning curve in managing scope, expectations, and cross-functional coordination.

Coordinated between Product, Engineering, Design, and Operations teams. Key operational changes: eliminated manual sales and onboarding processes (owners self-onboarded), shifted installation team to sending kits instead of performing installations, conducted thorough testing and run-throughs before release. Tracked owner signup rates (which increased dramatically), car utilization rates (initially decreased significantly), owner ratings, and customer service call volumes.

Faced significant challenges: initial low utilization and owner earnings led to disillusionment, increased customer service calls, borrower experience concerns. Implemented solutions: monitored and removed poor-performing owners, encouraged owners to use lockboxes to reduce friction, developed and rolled out self-installation kits which improved outcomes substantially.

Despite initial disruption and negativity, Key Swap became essential to company growth. By the time of Uber's acquisition, we reached 10,000 cars with 60% on Key Swap. The product was instrumental in demonstrating growth trajectory and scale that attracted acquisition interest - without it, the company likely wouldn't have reached the numbers needed to be an attractive acquisition target.

### 9. Strategic Project Prioritization: SEO vs Checkout Optimization (2018-2019) ⭐
**Quick Summary:** As Growth Lead, faced a critical decision: with a small team and limited capacity, we could only focus on one major growth initiative for the quarter - either SEO growth work or checkout optimization/conversion improvements. Both projects promised significant impact, but required full team focus, meaning choosing one meant delaying the other. 

To make a data-driven recommendation to the Leadership team, I gathered comprehensive data: analyzed existing SEO leads and their conversion rates, consulted with SEO experts to understand potential upside and time-to-value, and worked closely with our UX designer to assess the size of conversion opportunities in the checkout flow. Both initiatives would generate 'free' leads (organic SEO traffic vs improved conversion of existing traffic), so the decision required careful comparison of impact, timing, and strategic value.

Ultimately proposed prioritizing SEO work because: (a) SEO requires time to compound and grow, so starting earlier maximized long-term value, and (b) strategically, it was better to expand the top of the funnel first - getting more users into the system - before optimizing conversion rates. While checkout optimization had clear potential, building a larger organic traffic base first created a bigger foundation for future growth. We ultimately delivered both projects, but the strategic sequencing decision ensured we maximized impact given resource constraints.
